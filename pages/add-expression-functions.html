# Add functions you could use in custom expression

This is the only interface existing also in the 5.4.0 version.

Sometimes you want to integrate a function which will too big to integrate in a simple text field. 
For this you should create your own PHP functions.

In VtigerCRM 5.4: Create a new file inside modules/Workflow2/functions/ with the filename <individual>.inc.php
In VtigerCRM 6.x: Create a new file inside modules/Workflow2/extends/functions/ with the filename <individual>.inc.php
All functions with the nameprefix wf_ you define in this file, will be available during custom expressions.

Don't modify the core.inc.php File. There are the functions defined, which already come with Workflow Designer. 
But you could use this file as example, how your file should be build.

If you break the PHP Syntax and integrate an Error in this file, no Workflow could be executed, because this files are included in most tasks!

Example, which is currently integrated in Core:
